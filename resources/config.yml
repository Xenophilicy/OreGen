# This is where you can set the chance of the player getting an ore, versus getting the default!
# Example â†’ 32 means for every 32 blocks mined, there is a chance an ore will spawn (essentially)
Probability: 32

# Here you list the blocks you want players to have a chance of getting!
# Set any of them to false to disable their chance of being an outcome
